2 albeit intentional part dr sanderson lecture #20 eyewitness testimony false confessions needed revision section eyewitness testimony solid section false confessions materially inaccurate information
dr sanderson noted couple highprofile false confession cases specifically mentioned attributed false confessions reid technique (a technique criminal investigators us) body literature generated handful scholars asserted reid technique contributed false confession actual data support conclusions body literature absent lack scientific validation major reasons courts routinely admitted strictly limited testimony handful scholars cases defendant disputed confession
contrary reid critics asserted appropriately (in strict accordance reid guidelines) strong statistical argument reid technique produces valid confessions (the cases dr sanderson highlighted lecture involve interrogations fell reid guideline standards) evidence validity reid technique date comprehensive information false confessions collected members national registry exonerations gross possley (2016) explained members national registry exonerations collected data 1810 exonerations 1989 midjune 2016 exonerations period approximate 27year span 227 cases involved false confessions 13 percent total number exonerations people offered false confessions suffered intellectual disabilities mental illness and/or juveniles notably 15 false confessions provided adults intellectual disabilities mental illness unclear data percentage false confessions involved reid technique part investigator interrogation examples noted gross possley led false confessions fell acceptable standards reid technique
importantly number false confessions offered competent adults 27year period noted gross possley (2016) low statistically insignificant context total number felony criminal convictions period (which approximately 27 million) false confessions issue criminal justice system total numbers false confessions context total number felony convictions extremely low total number false confessions involve reid technique unknown statistically insignificant

l9 wastes great deal time inevitable scholars question written sources oral materials taking aim accurately early christians preserve pagan past “older" academic view “that people trust sourcesit native history all” circular arguments left meaningful "new" viewpoint
l9 “neither (archaeological dna) evidence supports idea ireland peopled series invasions" “yet dna evidence show strong correlationswith central europe show links irish inhabitants european atlantic seaboard including spain" ”…the book invasions (accidentally) right”
l12 “new” scholars a) christianity celtic lands b) brigid monastic figure goddess c) voyage brendan (while admitting "monks voyages”) fine offer credible proof existence “some” disagreeing modern scholars
“insider” trysts tone remarkably softens concentrates work incredibly organized wideranging method conversation ranges topic topic intuitive marvelous order ability meld traditions countries peoples events appreciated late hang there…its wonderful paxton takes charge pointed leaves intuitive grasp complex subject concluding remarks paxton defends removing term celtic – degree feel defend accepting rejecting hypothesis reflection understood

criticisms recommend fine basic primer
economists generally poor track record making accurate predictions (eg vast majority missed global meltdown began 2007) its easy discouraged dismiss field pseudoscientific nonsense theres nagging suspicion *something* were perpetually affected economic issues ignore peril
opinion short randall bartlett surprisingly good job sorting wheat chaff showing economics offer tools make decisions bartlett organizes tools categories 6 principles 3 core concepts bunch tools its straightforward put tools toolbox tools found noteworthy
(1) people respond incentives predict behavior means deliberately structure incentives ways foster decisions individual and/or social levels
(2) resources limited alternatives involve tradeoffs opportunity costs identify factor making decisions
(3) interaction involves sides sides making decisions
(4) recognize outcomes influenced factors cant anticipated and/or controlled likewise recognize decisions outcomes including outcomes external (“externalities”) cant anticipated and/or controlled short live uncertain complex world single individual organization control
(5) costs benefits alternatives evaluated “on margin” means relative (we rarely start scratch) alternative improvement status quo long marginal benefits exceed marginal costs weve optimized outcomes change yield greater benefits costs (the “equimarginal principle”) social level “pareto optimality/efficiency” state ones situation improved harming state isnt necessarily preferable fair (eg comparably low mediocre level level inequality unacceptable due proportion merit need)
(6) limited resources means eliminate risks achieve perfect safety optimum level safety determined marginal analysis accounting estimates probabilities outcomes people tend risk averse means theyre inclined avoid loss obtain equal gain people enjoy risk
(7) people make rational decisions understanding situations subjective values preferences understanding inaccurate were inherently subject sorts irrational biases heuristic shortcuts people cheat (eg “free riders”) bound outright undermine rationality acquiring information information gathering cost point marginal benefit additional information isnt worth marginal cost (ie theres thing “rational ignorance”) information gathering made efficient aggregation resources (eg social networking websites prediction markets) beware “information cascades” due groupthink market bubbles improve information gathering consulting specific people people (even “experts”) limitations “information asymmetries” occur people incentive withhold distort information (eg salespeople)
(8) people rationally pursue selfinterest play rules “prisoners dilemma” situations “invisible hand” doesnt work result worse (eg environmental degradation due “tragedy commons”) intervention external agent (eg government) structuring rules incentives required prevent move pareto optimality
(9) money generally worth present future reasons inflation erodes money money grow investment money gratification (as opposed delayed gratification) tradeoffs money spent cant investment
